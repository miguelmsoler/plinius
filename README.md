# Plinius - Automated Code Documentation Generator

## Description

Plinius is an Automated Code Documentation Generator designed to streamline the process of creating software documentation from source code directories. It supports a wide range of technologies, with a focus on Node.js and TypeScript, making it versatile for various project sizes and types, from microservices to monolithic solutions.

## Features

- **Automatic Documentation**: Generate comprehensive documentation directly from your source code.
- **Language Agnostic**: While optimized for Node.js and TypeScript, Plinius is adaptable to other languages and technologies.
- **Efficiency**: Designed to save developers time by automating a traditionally manual and time-consuming task.
